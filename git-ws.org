* objectives
** intro to version control
*** why version control?
**** enables efficient collaboration
     - work simultaneously on the same files
       - as opposed to files on a shared drive, for example
     - changes, even conflictig changes, are later merged in a controled way
**** audit trail
     - each commit is a discreet changeset; it's metadata describes:
       - who made the change
       - when s/he made the change
       - what the change is about (depends on the author following good practice!)
     - each commit is labeled with a unique id
       - a checksum (SHA1 hash) of the changeset itself
**** project snapshots
     - each commit id represents a snapshot of the project at the moment the commit was made
     - important commits can be celebrated as tags
       - alias that points to a particular snapshot of the project
     - snapshots are available for use at any time
**** differencing (diff-ing)
     - see the exact difference between two (not necessarily sequencial) versions (commits)
*** distributed
**** safety
     - everyone has a copy (a la LOCKSS network)
       - no single point of failure
       - backups for free
**** transparency / oversight
     - each person has the entire revision history of the repository

*** resources

** learn core git commands
** hands-on:
*** clone an existing repository
*** contribute to a project wiki

* concepts
** repository
** three-tree architecture
*** remote
*** staging index
*** local filesystem
** diff
* git commands
** push / pull
** clone
** branch
** tag
* bash commands
  - Bourne Again SHell :: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29
    - Tab-completion :: type a few characters of a valid pathname, for example, and the shell will finish the typing for you.
** cd /path/to/some/file :: change directory
** ls :: list the contents of a directory
** mkdir new-directory-name :: create a new directory
** rm :: delete a file (use these with care!!)
*** rm -r :: delete a directory and all of its contents
** pwd :: parent working directory (where am I?)
* workflow
*** git pull ['git clone' the first time]
*** git add
*** git commit
*** git push
*** git pull
